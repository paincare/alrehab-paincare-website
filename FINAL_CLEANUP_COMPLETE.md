# ✅ Final Cleanup Complete - All Issues Fixed

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Missing Icons on Services Page - FIXED**

**Problem**: Three icons not displaying on services page

**Fixed Icons**:
- **Joint Pain**: `fa-joints` (doesn't exist) → `fa-bone` ✅
- **Back & Neck Pain**: `fa-spine` (doesn't exist) → `fa-user-injured` ✅
- **Sports Injuries**: `fa-person-falling` (doesn't exist) → `fa-running` ✅

**File Updated**: `services.html` (lines 108, 118, 123)

---

### 2. ✅ **Fake Reviews Removed from Reviews Page**

**Problem**: 7 fake testimonials on reviews page

**Action Taken**: 
- Removed ALL fake reviews
- Kept ONLY the real Google review from Syed Mujtaba
- Added "Google Review" label for clarity
- Added button to view all reviews on Google Maps

**File Updated**: `reviews.html` (lines 58-78)

**Before**: 8 testimonials (1 real + 7 fake)  
**After**: 1 testimonial (100% real) ✅

---

### 3. ✅ **Local Image Implementation**

**Problem**: Image not loading from local folder

**Solution**: 
- Updated image path to use local file first
- Added Unsplash as fallback if local image fails
- Applied across all pages with images

**Image Path**: `images/physiotherapy-treatment.jpg`  
**Fallback**: Unsplash CDN (if local fails)

**Files Updated**:
- `index.html` (line 89) - Homepage about section
- `about.html` (line 51) - About page hero section

**⚠️ Important**: You need to save your actual image file to:
```
d:/Freelance&Business/Apps and Websites/Abdul Rahuman/AL-REHAB PAIN & PHYSIO CARE/images/physiotherapy-treatment.jpg
```

Currently the file exists but is empty (0 bytes). Save your physiotherapy knee image there.
