> "I went to Pain Care physio clinic for my shoulder pain. Doctor was very knowledgeable and diagnosed the problem and treated very well using advanced electrotherapy machines. I was surprised without Medicine my pain is 100% gone within few days. Doctor taught me exercise and activities which I should avoid. I then referred my neighbour Mr Saundaraj who had stroke and paralised one side. Doctor attended my call immediately and fixed appointment to visit at home. Very dedicated and knowledgeable person. I will surely recomed Pain Care physio clinic for everyone."
